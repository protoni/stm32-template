````bash
# Regulator AMS1117-3.3
- 5V -> 3.3V
- Needs 22uF tantalum capacitor for output filtering, if adjustment terminal is bypassed.
- Add 10uF tantalum cap for input

````bash
# USB
- Micro USB-B
- Leave shield floating

````bash
# Flashing
- Use 20 pin header with 2.54mm pitch for SEGGER j-link
  - VTref  -> VCC / 3.3V
  - GND    -> GND
  - TMS    -> SWDIO  (Serial Wire debug Data Input/Output)
  - TCK    -> SWDCLK (Serial Wire Clock)
  - TDO    -> SWO    (Serial Wire trace Output)
  - nRESET -> nRESET
  - leave rest of the pins unconnected
